| Web App     | There are a number of features on the web app which keep the user notified about the system status, as can be seen on the ‘bath loading’, ‘bath found’, and ‘timer’ pages. | The web app uses the language of the user - simple, readable phrases which are easy to understand                          | On the timer page there are buttons which allow the user to go back and change the settings or cancel the bath.                                                                                           | N/A - user doesn’t need to type anything in at any point - simple use of clicking buttons so no room for misinterpretation | Would need to add some verification, such as a confirmation pop up, to ensure the user selected the correct bath                                      |
| Desktop App | The desktop app includes slide listorders to visualize the status of each bath, and the analytics data by different time frames (weekly, monthly, annually)                | Very simple dashboard settings; all of the information can be easily read.                                                 | The user can simply change from bath status to expand a specific bath’s information                                                                                                                       | The incoming bathroom information is stored in JSON Arrays and saved locally on the computer in use.                       | The test sketch runs several tests and assertions to ensure the correct event handling and data processing of the app.                                |
| M5Stack     | Bath running status is displayed clearly on the display, however fault or connectivity statuses are not always visible. This information is always useful for the user     | All communications are conveyed in a familiar manner to non-technical users. Tests showed no misinterpretation of methods. | There is relatively little freedom in user control due to the limited functionality of the IoT platform. Emergency stops have been included to allow users to cancel baths as soon as they are commenced. | User actions are clear and definitive. There is no inconsistency in the interface that would confuse users.                | Functionality should be added to rescind/ undo repair and supply requests. This could be achieved using the web app to keep the IoT interface simple. |
