| Web App     | There are a number of features on the web app which keep the user notified about the system status, as can be seen on the ‘bath loading’, ‘bath found’, and ‘timer’ pages. | The web app uses the language of the user - simple, readable phrases which are easy to understand                          | On the timer page there are buttons which allow the user to go back and change the settings or cancel the bath.                                                                                           | N/A - user doesn’t need to type anything in at any point - simple use of clicking buttons so no room for misinterpretation | Would need to add some verification, such as a confirmation pop up, to ensure the user selected the correct bath                                      |
| Desktop App | The desktop app includes slide listorders to visualize the status of each bath, and the analytics data by different time frames (weekly, monthly, annually)                | Very simple dashboard settings; all of the information can be easily read.                                                 | The user can simply change from bath status to expand a specific bath’s information                                                                                                                       | The incoming bathroom information is stored in JSON Arrays and saved locally on the computer in use.                       | The test sketch runs several tests and assertions to ensure the correct event handling and data processing of the app.                                |
| M5Stack     | Bath running status is displayed clearly on the display, however fault or connectivity statuses are not always visible. This information is always useful for the user     | All communications are conveyed in a familiar manner to non-technical users. Tests showed no misinterpretation of methods. | There is relatively little freedom in user control due to the limited functionality of the IoT platform. Emergency stops have been included to allow users to cancel baths as soon as they are commenced. | User actions are clear and definitive. There is no inconsistency in the interface that would confuse users.                | Functionality should be added to rescind/ undo repair and supply requests. This could be achieved using the web app to keep the IoT interface simple. |

| Web App     | This requirement was not satisfied completely since the user does not get a confirmation of the selected options for the bath after pressing the GO button, but instead it just starts running the bath without double-checking if the user is happy with the choice. | Responsive aspect of web pages (using method windowResized) has meant that the website can be viewed on whatever device the user chooses      | Very clear layout displaying only the specific features required by the user.                                                      | As highlighted in User Control, there are buttons on the timer page whereby the user can go back and change the settings or even cancel the bath.                                                                                                                                                | Documentation should not be necessary for the web app as it is focused on the user’ s tasks and the consumer is walked through a list of explicit steps when navigating the app.                                                          |
| Desktop App | The desktop does not implement any options to change user data. Hence, this criteria does not apply. However, it will be considered in future stages of the design.                                                                                                   | The app opens at a size of (900,700) therefore the criteria of flexibility is not satisfied since opening it on a phone would cause problems. | The controlp5 added an important aesthetic aspect to the app. Yet, the graphics are low quality. The layout is clear and simple.   | This needs to be added to the current design as it is not present. In fact, there is some trouble with the “cancel” button.                                                                                                                                                                      | It was decided that a help and documentation section was not going to be included for the app (most developers will have built the platforms themselves). Yet, it will definitely need to be included later as new employers join Bubble. |
| M5Stack     | There is no data or parameter required for user recall in the platform - all parameters are displayed clearly on screen.                                                                                                                                              | Given the M5Stack device, flexibility in the platform created is limited strictly to M5Stack  features and functionality.                     | The prototype interface is highly minimalistic and functional. All M5Stack buttons are used, maximising the simplicity of control. | The platform design could be improved to give the user more information regarding any faults that the system has. Small status indicators would give satisfactory information. Ideally the platform would also have an indication of the progress that Bubble is making to fix technical issues. | The simplicity of the interface causes no documentation to be necessary. As the interface is developed and features are added, documentation will be required to explain symbols and any complicated functionality.                       |
