## Social and Ethical implications of the project

Product architecture and business development were guided by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. They provide a general framework to ensure operations and products are aimed towards a benefit to society and also outline professional and leadership responsibilities.

### User evaluation and system trials during further product development and trials

In the future, as the system is developed and more significant user evaluation is required, including the possibility of system trials in participant’s homes, ethical and social responsibility will become more crucial. For these phases of development, consent forms and comprehensive participant information sheets must be made in order to achieve complete transparency and understanding with the trial users.

### Adoption, installation and long-term system function

In order to install the system, a technician/ plumber will need to access peoples homes and permission to change plumbing installations, namely the tap valves, which will need to be connected to the IoT device. Furthermore, if the customer has any difficulties or faults with their product, continued access must be granted for technicians to attend and repair systems. This process comes with many ethical implications and complications. Primarily, the team would need to ensure the credibility and trustworthiness of the technicians to prevent incidents occurring during home visits. The team would also need to ensure that they are adequately qualified to advise and make safe choices about the product’s installation. All final products will be IP68 rated to ensure “water resistance against long periods of immersion” (www.plumbworld.co.uk/bathroom-zones-ip-rating-infopage), however the positioning of Bubble products in the bathroom also require significant knowledge and understanding. For example, the voltage of the final products will determine the minimum distance away from the bath itself where they can be placed. Any components that must be placed within the bath structure itself, such as the tap valves, must have a maximum voltage of 12V. Bubble technicians will have to be trained and experienced with these regulations to ensure ethical and legal standards are met.

For long term operation, the bathroom products should be equipped with features that safeguard against electrical faults before any damage to their environment can be caused. Significant safety factors need to be included in the electrical design of the product because of damage to customer’s homes and potential threat to human life that electrical faults can cause. 

### Disruption of bath specific plumbing/ installation industry

While the automation and incorporation of ‘smart’ technologies is generally considered a modern positive trend, it often reduces reliance on traditional industry practices which likely employ more people than the new more automated solution. This is likely to be the case in bubble’s adoption too - while it is true that bubble would employ and train existing industry professionals to service our products, increased reliability and improved self-diagnostic features of our products may also cause a reduction of industry professional call outs in the longer term. If bubble were to be adopted on a large scale, it may have detrimental effects on employment in the industry, which is certainly a negative ethical factor of the project we are trying to achieve.

### Data Security, Privacy & User Anonymity

Using publicly viewable and downloadable software from Github leaves our systems vulnerable to external interference and data theft. By giving access to the details of the system architecture to anyone on the internet makes the task of interrupting or monitoring the processes much easier. After the prototyping stage, significant and private changes to Bubble’s data persistence systems will have to be made to ensure the security of Bubble user data.

In the long term, user data would be split; one database contains user habits/ bath running analytics, and another contains personal user data such as their name and address. Bathing or bathroom activity is an innately private activity, so users may be naturally against the introduction of a ‘middleman’ or data recording service in the bathroom. The business development benefit that the team could gain from user behavior analytics is not reduced by user anonymity, and therefore will be implemented for the user’s privacy. This anonymity is increasingly important for customers in an increasingly data privacy aware society. Personal details, payments methods and other sensitive details will be protected with modern and adequate measures.

### Environmental impact

While environmental impact once installed should be relatively minimal, there would be environmental costs in the production and transport of our products. As a team committed to sustainability and green practice, measures to offset environmental impact despite detriment to profits would be explored.

### Mechanical safety features

Due to the nature of Bubble services, there is an ethical responsibility to allow users to manually stop bath runs with a mechanical ‘emergency stop’ feature. In case of electrical malfunction, this is an important safety feature to give the customer backup in case of unexpected or dangerous system behaviour. While the team does not foresee this feature being used in normal operation, it will encourage customers to feel safe and assured using the products and provide a mechanism to prevent or limit damage should unsafe system operation occur.
