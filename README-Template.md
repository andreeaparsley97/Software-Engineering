# Our Mission
Over the last decade, the idea of mass automation has excitingly shifted from a vague possibility to an imminent reality. In the last few years, the world has seen these advancements introduced into professional experience. Society has now discovered the power of these tools when integrated into our homes to complete everyday chores and increase leisure time. 

In the midst of this automation revolution, taking a bath is trailing the other activities that are undergoing a transformation. The advantages of baths are powerful; from having anti-aging properties, to being one of the most successful stress relief techniques. From an environmental standpoint, a bath consumes, on average, half the amount of water than an average shower. 

Bubbles aims to seize this opportunity and automate bath taking by providing the necessary technology to prepare and adjust the user’s desires when taking a bath. The product is composed of an M5Stack that controls the water supply and a Web app where users can choose the temperature and quantity of bubbles. Most people disregard taking baths mainly because it is a time consuming process. With Bubbles, one can prepare their bath while commuting home or finishing their workout. Our motto is clear: do less, enjoy more. 

### Sections Overview
The portfolio is composed of three main sections. Firstly, the system design section considers the architecture of the entire system and the design process to turn a paper prototype into a software environment. The second section details the implementation techniques and methods used to produce a working prototype. Lastly, the evaluation section will analyse the final prototype, as well as touch on future work and working practices during the project. 

## System Design 

Bubbles aims to automate baths in the world, allowing your bathroom to become a ‘smart bath’. The product is composed of three different but integrated platforms; a Web App, a Desktop App and an M5Stack. 

In this section, we will cover the chosen architecture of the entire system, the design methods used for the key subsystems and the evaluation we applied to the product. This section will also provide a full explanation of the design process, from paper prototyping to software application. Providing three user stories will also highlight the opportunity the Bubbles team is set to seize in the current bath market.


## System Implementation

## Project Evaluation  

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
