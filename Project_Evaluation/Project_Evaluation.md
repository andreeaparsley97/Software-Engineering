# Section 3: Project Evaluation

As an entire project, the team is highly satisfied that our main ambitions for the project have been achieved and even bettered in some cases. Despite the disappointing consequences that COVID-19 has had on our ability to discuss, improve and share our product, we are satisfied that we have engaged with contingency arrangements to replace these experiences as much as possible. The evaluation of each platform can be found in [Evaluation of Platform Designs](https://github.com/jupozuelo/Software-Engineering/blob/master/System_Implementation/System_Implementation.md#evaluation-of-platform-designs).

## Reflective discussion of success of project

Evaluating the project as a whole is a process that also includes a comparison of our software engineering skills before and after the process. As a method for exploring and familiarising ourselves with software engineering tools, philosophies and practices, the project was highly successful. The team has been exposed to new technologies and methodologies, such as p5.js and agile development philosophies, which will certainly be applicable in future projects and development processes. Even outside software development, transferable skills such as rapid product prototyping and collaboration methods have been gained. This will give the team greater confidence going forward into industry, where development concepts may now be familiar, or suggested by team members to development practice in their industry too.

The impact of the COVID-19 crisis is evident in the different level of documentation detail and legnth when comparing system design and system implementation. Unfortunately, the implementation stages were significantly disrupted while the crisis began, our university environment closed down and the team members had to return home to three different countries. This has limited some of the skills that the team have gained from the process, particularly around presentation and system demonstration. The team were disappointed not to be able to implement our system further - we had ambitions of a working integrated physical model to simulate some water flow on command from the web app via the M5Stack. We hope to gain such experience after the COVID-19 crisis eases.

The balance between task allocation/ division of labour and productive collaboration practices (such as pair programming) was explored and adhered to as much as COVID-19 working conditions allowed. Our original desired balance was not possible due to working separately across three time zones. In industry, the team may benefit from non-distanced collaborative practices which were unfortunately not possible in this project. The development sprints of our agile working philosophy encouraged us to work with constant unit-testing and self-evaluation on our working practices. The team embraced change in the service’s design and architecture more than in previous work and aimed to continuously integrate changes to keep the service ‘working’ at all times. These experiences have all been considered vital to our development as engineers and are highly likely to prove useful in future.

From the innumerable popular Agile methodologies, the team found Scrum and Extreme Programming to be valuable lessons when developing the systems. The team engaged with the implementation of the cycles of product development known as sprints, as well as the 5 minutes "daily scrum". This brought a good dynamic to the project and created a sense of motivation in order to complete the tasks required for each sprint before moving to the next one. XP is a great method to work in parallel with Scrum by linking the user stories with the sprints. By enforcing XP, the level of productivity and efficiency was increased as the code became more complex. This encouraged, for example, frequent code review and pseudo (distanced) pair programming when developing the Web App. A methodology the team would have liked to implement in less distanced working conditions is Crystal Clear, however the need for physical meetings and the reflection on improvements made this impossible whilst everyone worked remotely. A method the team would be keen to experiment with in the future is the Kanban method, since it offers a better workflow overview for each task (started, testing, completed) and is more responsive to change when compared to the Scrum Method. With Kanban, changes can be made at any time, while Scrum excludes any alteration mid-way through sprints. However, the team should keep in mind that having no prescribed roles in Kanban can bring confusion on the approproiate workload for each member and hence meeting the timeframe for the final product delivery. A balance should be found.

The project provided further group working and collaboration experience for the team. This practice was exaggerated and stressed by the impact of COVID-19 has had on communication, but some positives can be drawn. If industry work has to continue enforcing social distancing and/or working from home, the team now has first hand experience on how to deal with that disruption in a structured and efficient manner. Many software engineering jobs are freelance too, hence working physically in isolation but collaboratively over the internet is a useful experience that will likely be replicated in future work, COVID-19 or not.

The process of this project has given the team the confidence to believe they can tackle complex and initially abstract problems with good and incremental software design, and has encouraged the members to do so in future.

## Evaluation of group working practice

### Github and collaborative working tools

Github was adopted early in this process to familiarise all team members with its features and collaborative benefits. Even before any technical content was written, it was used to share images of the paper prototype and to record notes from group work. During the early phases of development parallel changes to the repository were rare, so any limitations to git were not encountered. However as the project progressed and working conditions became more distant, there were elements of the git repository that multiple team members needed to make changes to simultaneously, in particular parallel editing of development notes, report write-ups and other text files. Therefore the group decided to take these collaborative documents away from git and edit them simultaneously using Google Docs until their final version was ready for translation into markdown files and storage on the Github Repository.

### Test-driven development

The system requirements of each platform were translated into feature tests to allow working with a test-driven development philosophy. The aim by using this philosophy was to keep the focus on the platform requirements, to simplify the debugging process and maintain high code quality standards throughout development. Unfortunately, as the project progressed these system requirements and tests were continuously shifted. This was partially due to the growth in knowledge and experience of the team as the project went on, and also partially due to a change in the scope of the project that we wanted to achieve due to COVID-19 disruption. Detrimentally, new restrictive working conditions slowed progress causing a reduction in target feature quantity and prototype feature quality.

As much as possible during the early stages of the project, continuous integration was executed. It was ensured that any new additions to programming scripts passed all tests related to that particular feature, before committing it to the shared codebase in Github. This way the team was able to protect the correct functioning of other subsystems and the system as a whole throughout development.


### Pair Programming

Under normal working conditions, the group had agreed that working in pairs on the different platforms was ideal. Pair work would encourage momentum in tasks and allow for a more evaluative working process - two opinions are better than one. A study on the impact of pair programming on productive output showed a 127% increase in code quantity, and a significant decrease in the number of coding errors (Jensen, 2003).  

However due to the distanced working enforced by the COVID-19 crisis, working in pairs became more challenging for practical and communicative reasons. Practically, only the team member with the M5Stack was able to build, test and demonstrate the IoT platform functionality. Additionally with the desktop and web applications, reduced communication and eliminated physical co-working reduced the speed of the development progress. Significant extra time was spent communicating ideas and updates on progress, which could have been avoided if working in closer proximity was possible. Namely, the team often needed to communicate via text on a Facebook Messenger group since the team were unable to match working schedules in different time zones. Working physically together not only allows synchronised learning schedules, but also the greater efficiency of constant verbal communication. The team would hope that future work could be carried out under more usual circumstances, that would allow us to gain the benefit of pair programming and physical co-working.

### Limited team members

With just 4 team members working on this project, the division of project aims and tasks was challenging. All members had to serve multiple purposes and be familiar with the entire system. With large individual workloads and significant crossover in tasks, easy and concise communication was essential to ensure two things: that all team members were aware of the development progress for each feature and platform, and that all project goals were being maintained continuously. The difficulty of this challenge was again exaggerated by COVID-19’s impact on studies and working conditions - by reducing the time we had to work on the project, we were less able to compensate low numbers for longer hours. In future work, recruiting more team members would help to alleviate larger workloads, and perhaps allow for greater efficiency via improved division of labour.

## Discussion of future work

In future, the project would benefit from the following adjustments and development focuses.

### Design phase - notes for future work

In future iterations of UI designs, similar fast prototyping methods would be employed to maintain our agile development philosophy. However, the specific prototyping tools should be reconsidered to maximise the shareability of our prototype with non-technical participants - a platform such as Marvel app for UI design is more friendly to non-technical participants than a processing file. Given Bubble’s service is focused on consumers in the general public, insights from participants without software engineering experience would be very valuable. 

### Development phase - notes for future work

In future development, the team should increase its commitment to object-orientated programming. This will allow the entire project to further benefit from: code simplicity gains from widespread inheritance, code readability and tidiness gains from abstraction and reduction in redundant code from polymorphism. The current code in all three platforms is relatively rudimentary, therefore the concepts of inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism did not appear to be of significant relevance weighed up against our dedication to making the system work. Object Oriented Programming was taught alongside this unit, so the concepts only became familiar as the process went along. Over time as the team become more experienced programmers, there will be scope for the code to become more complex, and these object-oriented measures will be more necessary to sustain the readability and maintainabiltiy of the programs.  

### Evaluation phase - notes for future work
In the future, the team is looking to implement a Lab Usability Testing method for all systems to account for the difference in knowledge and perception between users and developers. Test subjects will be asked to complete specific tasks on the Web App, Desktop App and M5Stack. Although tests will take place in a controlled environment, and therefore are not a certain reflection of real-life usage, this change will still be beneficial because it allows the project's key stakeholders to observe the process for a better understanding of consumer behaviour. It will assist in solving the issues that might give an unpleasant user experience for those who might not understand the technology behind the service. As Bubble products become more sophisticated, the team will run A/B testing when evaluting new UI designs. This involves giving different test subjects one of a number of new versions of the platform and measuring performance indices which help determine which version the best. This will create quantifable evaluation to inform the design and navigation of the user interface in the web app, IoT platform and even desktop app.

### Web Application - next steps
When considering steps to take in development for the future, extended features could be added to the Web app to provide it with more functionality. Whilst currently it is very straightforward to select a bath and choose one’s desired settings, there is room for improvement when it comes to added options. One potential idea would be to add a page in which one can order more bath supplies on the go, widening the usage of the application. Of course, this is currently an option on the Smart Bath device itself (M5Stack), however as yet this is limited. Similarly to the extensive ways one can select their bath (toggle for temperature, depth and bubbles), there could be a page with a range of bath supplies such as soap, shampoo, conditioner etc. which one can browse from and place an order. Another area of improvement could be represented by the implementation of a user specific bath history which would retrieve data from the Desktop App. Moreover, the ‘favourites’ system should be developed, whereby the settings a user most commonly selects is suggested when they open the app, thus speeding up the process. 

More significantly, the Web application can be extended to a mobile app form. As Bubble is branded as a software for people on-the-go, this would be a very desirable feature. Users would be able to download the app straight onto their mobile phones and avoid having to access Bubble through a browser. The mobile-view UI figure in Section 2 demonstrate how the Web application would appear dynamically on a phone, therefore it is simple to visualise how this app would be designed. This is something that the team would be very excited to create, however due to a lack of tools it was not possible in the current climate. In the future, the team is looking at experimenting with a cross-platform tool like Angular or a customizable feature offering tool like Bootstrap or a lightweight, Python tool as Flask, in order to replace the p5.js library used. 

### Desktop Platform - next steps

The desktop app behaves as the back-end of the product, storing user information and valuable data to gather insights from. This data visualisation aspect adds a hint of front-end to the application, allowing developers to understand the product’s performance. The main focus of future work should be on converting the current JSON text-based array database into a functional relational database. Currently, the desktop application receives and stores bata data using: 
    
    for (JSONObject bath: db.baths) {
       if (bath != null) {
          if (status.contains(bath.getString("bath_status"))) {
             ret = (JSONObject[]) append(ret, order);
          }
       }
    }
    
    void saveBathtoDB(JSONObject bath) {
        if (bath == null) {
            return;
        } else {
            saveJSONObject(bath, "data/" + bath.getString("bath_id") + ".json");
        }
    }

This procedure will probably involve using a specific database language, such as MySQL, integrated to the current Processing sketches. This integration could bring some technical difficulties, hence the team might need to consider moving away from Processing to build the back-end of the product. Having the database and the GUI for the desktop app in different platforms would avoid having a single point of failure in the system. 

Additionally, the back-end team would benefit from increased data analytics on the bath data. Currently, the prototype records four measures but by including rates and statistical modelling, the admin team could have a better understanding of how Bubble is performing. To better understand the client’s needs, the desktop app should include a section where it receives and collects user’s reviews. Personalizing the user’s experience will build towards the success of the product. 

### IoT Device - next steps

Future IoT work will be focused in part on the practicalities of connecting the IoT device to the mechanics of a bathtub to enable Bubble to deliver the service this prototype simulates. In practice it is likely to require replacement of many tap valves to allow for automated rather than manual opening and closing. Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control will be used to achieve the desired water temperature as quickly and efficiently as possible, while bath depth will have to be measured using sensors to determine when to cut off the water supply. Additionally, work to incorporate automated plug mechanics is essential to ensure the water is run into a plugged bath, and to enable the release of cancelled baths. Any new parts or products should be designed with self-diagnostic fault catching features where possible. This will allow the team to give greater visibility to the user or plumber in case of malfunction. The team intended to achieve some of this research and design to have a partially actuated system connected to the M5Stack to demonstrate at this point. However, due to a lack of lab access, tools and available time this was not possible during the COVID-19 crisis.

## Final Thoughts

What started as a group project with expectations for the team to accomplish a set of Software Engineering workshop sessions, soon became an opportunity to experiment with the daily practices of a digital nomad or software developer. We were given free rein to explore different methodologies and learn from their benefits. It also highlighted the difference between classical 9-to-5 office practice versus the more dynamic product design and development process we adopted -  often working at unusual times of the day and frequently having to collaborate exclusively online. Last but not least, the project brought together 4 people from different backgrounds (Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering and Liberal Arts) and showed the importance of a variety of transferable skills gained in the previous years, while developing strong new technical skills and development philosophies.
